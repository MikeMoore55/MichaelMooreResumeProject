notes to lectures:

comments with the "[to michael]" is for the main developer (me "michael") this helps me identify the sections easier to making any sort of editing easier. (you can use this for referencing if you want)

everything in the css stylesheet is in chronological order and flows along with the order of the html code.

Your code must meet the following specifications:

Page sections should be determined using semantic HTML. HTML tags should accurately describe the hierarchy of the information on the page. 

All CSS styling should be in a separate stylesheet. No CSS styling should be in your HTML file. 

CSS styling should be used to determine the circular shape of the image. 

Page sections should be separated by appropriate padding, borders and margins.
